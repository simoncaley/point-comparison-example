# QA Technical Exercise

A customer has requsted a new tool that can compare a list of coordinate points. The tool must allow the user to input a list of coordinate point pairs and find the following:

- Find the closest pair of coordinate points and their distance apart.
- Find the pair of coordinate points which is furthest apart and their distance.
- The average distance between every coordinate point pair.

## Acceptance Criteria

- An input box will accept the points as comma separated pairs with each pair of coordinate point separated by a space, e.g. 0.0,1.0 2.0,3.0 4.0,5.0.
- If two pairs of points are equally close or equally far apart, then it doesn't matter which of the pairs is shown.
- If invalid input is provided, then an error message should be displayed.
- Coordinate points should be output to 1 decimal place and distances to 2 decimal places.
- The tool should be able to handle upto 10 pairs of coordinate points.

## Production Link

A link for the tool can be found here: [Point Comparison Tool](http://qa-technical-exercise.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com)

## Deliverables

- Test cases to cover the tool's usage.
- Bug reports for any bugs, if any, which are uncovered.
