# Request For More Information

The following are items to be discussed with the client and/or development for clarification on whether tools needs further updates or logged as bugs.

- Start and End coordinate points can only single number coordinates (example: 2 or 5.4), should they be able to be pairs also?

- Error messages are generic - "Please make sure the input follows the format required", should more descriptive messages be included (see following examples)?:

  - If alphabet letters were used in input - "Please remove incorrect 'alphabet letters' from coordinate inputs"
  - If additional spaces were used in input - "Please remove additional 'spaces' from coordinate inputs"

- Should "Analyse" button be changed to grey (or similar colour) when inactive, to better definite that it is inactive?

- Should a "Reset" / "Reload" button be included on the page to allow the coordinate to be cleared and any previous results removed from page, without the need to refresh the page.

- Should the previous run results also be displayed on the page (possibly below) the current results to allow the client to analyse the differences.

- Could the page be setup to separate boxes to handle each coordinate pair, as current format is hard to understand coordinate pairs.
